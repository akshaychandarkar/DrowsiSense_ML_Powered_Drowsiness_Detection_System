# DrowsiSense: ML-Powered Drowsiness Detection System

## Overview
DrowsiSense is a real-time monitoring system designed to detect driver drowsiness and enhance safety. By utilizing machine learning and computer vision technologies, it continuously monitors eye states through a webcam and provides alerts to prevent fatigue-related accidents.

## Features
• **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously tracks the driver’s eye state.

• **High Accuracy:** Achieves a 95% detection rate with an EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) threshold of 0.26.

• **Alert System:** Issues alerts when drowsiness is detected.

• **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms for precise detection.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **OpenCV:** For video stream capture and image processing.
- **Dlib:** For facial landmark detection.
- **Numpy & Scipy:** For numerical operations and distance calculations.
- **Playsound:** For generating audible alerts.
